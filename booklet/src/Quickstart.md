# Quickstart

Hextacy is a library aimed to provide a flexible infrastructure for writing backend applications. It provides traits which can be utilised to model applications based on behaviour, as well as some out of the box adaptations of those traits. You can think of hextacy as a kind of but not really spring bootleg for rust.
