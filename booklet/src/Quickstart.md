# Quickstart

Hextacy is a library aimed to provide a flexible infrastructure for writing backend applications. It provides you with out of the box implementations so you can focus on the business aspects of your application without reinventing the wheel. Hextacy is a little opinionated, but it tries to be as less intrusive as possible. If its implementations do not suit your needs, it provides you with a set of traits so you can always roll out your own.

This booklet serves to explain why hextacy is built the way it is, as well as provide some context for the traits it exposes.
